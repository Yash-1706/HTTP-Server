Multi-threaded HTTP Server - Demo Text File
===========================================

This is a sample text file for testing binary file downloads.

The server should serve this file with:
- Content-Type: application/octet-stream
- Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="demo.txt"

This triggers a download in the browser rather than displaying the content.

Features Tested:
- Binary mode file reading
- Proper Content-Disposition headers
- Streaming file transfer with 8KB chunks
- Keep-alive connection support

End of file.
